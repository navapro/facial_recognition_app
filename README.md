# Facial Recognition AI

- Developed a siamese neural network to recognize my face based on a research paper and open source data.
- Trained and implemented the model on Google colab using Tensorflow and Keras with Jupyter Notebook for segmented execution
- Achieved 90% facial recognition accuracy on test set and 70% accuracy on real life shots.
## Tech Stack

Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Kivy, Pandas
